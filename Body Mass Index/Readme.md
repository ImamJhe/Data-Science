## Description:
A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight. <br>
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced. <br>
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

### This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female

Height : Number (cm)

Weight : Number (Kg)

### Index :
0 - Extremely Weak <br>
1 - Weak <br>
2 - Normal <br>
3 - Overweight <br>
4 - Obesity <br>
5 - Extreme Obesity <br>

### Objective:
Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). <br>
Build classification models to predict the various categories of BMI. <br>
Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms.
