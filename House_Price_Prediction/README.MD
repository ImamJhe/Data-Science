### This dataset contains selling prices for homes for King County, which includes Seattle. 

This includes homes sold between May 1900 and May 2015. This is a good data set for evaluating simple regression models. <br>

This dataset has 21 attributes, including the following: <br>

<pre>
id            : A notation for a house <br>
date          : Date house was sold <br>
price         : Price is prediction target <br>
bedrooms      : Number of bedrooms <br>

sqft_living   : Square footage of the home <br>
sqft_lot      : Square footage of the lot <br>
floors        : Total floors (levels) in house <br>
waterfront    : House which has a view to a waterfront <br>
view          : Has been viewed <br>
condition     : How good the condition is overall <br>
grade         : overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system <br>
sqft_above    : Square footage of house apart from basement <br>
